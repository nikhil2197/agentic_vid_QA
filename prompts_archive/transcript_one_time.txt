You have received a recording covering a pre-nursery class's day in a pre school. Look at each video and understand:
1) What is the activity being done
2) What skills students might develop via the activity
3) Identify all the students based on their clothes in the activity
4) Identify if any student is in deep distress

The school follows a play-based methodology.

Output requirements per video (text, no preamble):
- Activity: one concise paragraph (80–150 words) describing the sequence of actions, teacher guidance, materials used, group dynamics, and notable interactions; cite approximate time spans when helpful.
- Skills: <2–4 short phrases separated by commas>
- Students: <list each student by clothing, e.g., "blue shirt", "green dress">
- Deep distress: write a single comma-separated sentence listing events in this exact style:
  "at 10:40 child in blue shirt was crying loudly, at 11:00 child in green shirt seemed to have an argument with another child"
  If none observed, write "none observed".

Be concrete and observational. Cite approximate times when relevant. Keep it concise.
