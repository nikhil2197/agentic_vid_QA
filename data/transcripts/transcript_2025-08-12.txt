  Start: 600  End: 625
  Description: Circle Time with rhymes and songs to settle in for the day with friends.

Activity:
The activity is a "Circle Time" session designed to settle the children into the day. It begins with a gradual entry of children and teachers into the classroom between 10:04 and 10:06. Children are guided to sit on individual blue and white patterned mats arranged in a circle around a central grey mat. The teachers lead the children in singing songs and rhymes, incorporating hand gestures and body movements like standing up and bending down (e.g., 10:05-10:07). The group dynamics are collaborative, with teachers actively engaging each child, offering physical support and encouragement. Materials include the floor mats. Notable interactions involve teachers holding children, guiding their movements, and encouraging participation in the songs. The session transitions from active movement to seated engagement as more children arrive and the group settles.

  Description: Hopscotch and Floor is Lava while learning how to count and improve balance

Activity:
The activity is a combination of hopscotch and "Floor is Lava" with an educational twist, taking place in a large, open room with wooden flooring. It begins around 10:50 with children entering the designated play area. The setup includes a line of colorful circular mats (red, yellow, green, blue, orange) followed by a longer line of numbered foam mats (1-10). Teachers guide the children to navigate these mats. For the circular mats, the children are encouraged to step on them, simulating "Floor is Lava" where the floor is lava and the mats are safe spots. For the numbered mats, the children perform hopscotch, hopping on the numbers in sequence. Teachers actively participate, demonstrating the actions, counting aloud, and encouraging the children. Materials used include the colorful circular mats, numbered foam mats, and small balls which are scattered on the floor and later collected by the children. The group dynamics involve children taking turns, observing each other, and interacting with the teachers. The activity appears to be structured with clear instructions and teacher guidance throughout the session.
